# AUTO-INSURANCE-FRAUD-DETECTION

In this project we build a Flask Application for a classification methodology to determine whether a customer is placing a fraudulent insurance claim based on a small imbalanced dataset.

The following are the steps to set up the project:

1. Create a python virtual environment and activate it
2. Install dependencies using "pip install -r requirements.txt"
3. Run the application by executing "python3 main.py"
